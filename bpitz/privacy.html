  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Bpitz does not collect or store personal information such as names, email addresses, or other identifying information. However, when you use our AI lyric generation feature, the content you input (prompts, keywords, or themes) is sent to OpenAI's servers to generate lyrics.

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>The content you input (prompts, keywords, or themes) is sent to OpenAI's API solely for the purpose of generating rap lyrics. We do not store, analyze, or use this content for any other purpose. Each request is processed independently and is not linked to your device or any personal identifier.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>We do not store any user content locally on our servers. However, your input content is transmitted to OpenAI's servers through their API for lyric generation. OpenAI handles this data according to their own privacy policy and data retention practices. We recommend reviewing OpenAI's privacy policy for details on how they handle and protect your data.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Bpitz integrates with OpenAI's API to provide AI-powered lyric generation. When you use the app's lyric generation feature, your input content is sent to OpenAI's servers for processing. We do not integrate with any other third-party services for login, analytics, or advertising.</p>
  <p>We confirm that any third party with whom our app shares user data provide the same or equal protection of user data as stated in the appâ€™s privacy policy and required by these Guidelines.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Privacy Choices</h2>
  <p>By using Bpitz's AI lyric generation feature, you consent to your input content being sent to OpenAI for processing. If you do not wish to share your content with OpenAI, you can choose not to use the lyric generation feature. We do not collect any personal information that would require privacy settings or account options.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, with the "Effective Date" updated accordingly.</p>
