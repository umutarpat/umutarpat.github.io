  <p>Constellation Finder ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data when you use our mobile application, <strong>Constellation Finder</strong>.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Constellation Finder does not collect or store personal information such as names, email addresses, or other identifying information. However, when you use our AI scan feature, the content you input (Image of the sky) is sent to Gemini's servers to generate scan data. This content is processed but not stored by us locally.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>The content you input (image of the sky) is sent to Gemini's API solely for the purpose of generating constellation/star analysis. We do not store, analyze, or use this content for any other purpose. Each request is processed independently and is not linked to your device or any personal identifier.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>We do not store any user content locally on our servers. However, your input content is transmitted to Gemini's servers through their API for constellation/star analysis.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Constellation Finder integrates with Gemini's API to provide AI-powered constellation/star analysis. When you use the app's constellation/star analysis feature, your input content is sent to Gemini's servers for processing. We do not integrate with any other third-party services for login, analytics, or advertising.</p>
  <p>We confirm that any third party with whom our app shares user data provide the same or equal protection of user data as stated in the appâ€™s privacy policy.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Privacy Choices</h2>
  <p>By using Constellation Finder's AI constellation/star analysis feature, you consent to your input content being sent to Gemini for processing. If you do not wish to share your content with Gemini, you can choose not to use the constellation/star analysis feature. We do not collect any personal information that would require privacy settings or account options.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update privacy policy from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated terms. The "Effective Date" above will reflect the most recent version.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
